## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This application utilizes machine learning for banknote recognition. Due to time constraints and challenges in gathering comprehensive image datasets, the model may occasionally misidentify non-currency objects.  
üîé *For example*: Scanning random objects like pillows might result in incorrect detections (e.g., detecting "5 euros" erroneously).  

**Users are advised to scan valid banknotes to ensure accurate recognition.** While WalletLight strives for high accuracy, it cannot guarantee perfect results in all scenarios.
